api Call in js
----------------
AJAX

-XMLhtp
-fetch
-asynch await



redirection in react
--------------------------

react-router-dom:-npm i react-router-dom

 BrowserRouter as Router-All roting need components
 ,Routes-To set path For each Components
 ,Route - more than one path



useParams-hook used to access params from component url



REDUX
-----

coupling-  Many connections between parrent5 and child component

Props Drilling- in Coup,ling if any intermediate component have any errors all other child wil not work

to avoid props drilling we neeed to reduce coupling and make all the components indipendent


for this react introduced new technology- state management technology-REDUX


Redux Process
------------------

Create a new js file to keep the states,all the components can access the js file 

components can only access data from data.js , cannot modify it in there


component access data from data.js and do a dispatch call/request to the action file where all the logic is implemented.

all logic to modify / update data is stored inside action file.

The response from the action file is send to Reducer file as a payload.Reducer will in turn update the data in the data.
Dispatch -> Method used to dispatch the logic in action file when the component need state updation 


Reducer->  update the datas in js file according to the payload response get from action file



Libraries to apply redux
-------------------------
REDUX
REACT-REDUX
REDUX-THUNk


createStore-method used to create store in js file
            expects 2 arguments
                1)reducer
                2)middleware - used to make sychronus redux to asynchronus

  appluMiddleware() -method in Redux to apply middleware


combineReducers() - method in Redux to combine all the reducers in js file

thunk()-used to create Middleware


1)create store
2)apply the store in index.js  
                -provider-
                    is a tag used to pass the store (react-redux)
